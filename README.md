Description:
This code trains and evaluates a Random Forest classifier on GST data 
with preprocessed features. The model predicts whether a transaction 
belongs to class 0 or 1 based on 21 features. The accuracy and 
classification metrics are displayed along with the feature importance.

Steps:
1. Data loading and merging (features and target).
2. Data preprocessing (missing values handling and scaling).
3. Model training using Random Forest.
4. Model evaluation and feature importance analysis.
